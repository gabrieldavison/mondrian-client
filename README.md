utxt is a tool for building simple web pages out of text boxes.

These pages can be viewed and edited by anyone with a link. You can also choose to password protect a page to restrict who can edit it.

Currently I use it to store a [list of links for my instagram bio](https://utxt.page/links).

This project was built using React, Express, Node.js and sqlite.

Features I want to add...

[ ] Improved markdown support (currently some tags are not working)
[x] Export page data to json / import page data
[ ] Export page to html file so you can host / edit it yourself.
[ ] Custom stylesheets
[ ] Allow embedding of one page inside another.
