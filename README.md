Mondrian is a tool for building simple web pages out of text boxes.

It's currently in its very early stages.

At the moment it can be used to build single pages formatted using markdown. These pages can be viewed and edited by anyone with a link.

Try out the demo to see how this works.

This project was built using React for the front end and Node.js with Postgres on the back end.

Features that are coming soon...

[ ] Improved markdown support (currently some tags are not working)
[ ] Drag and drop functionality for reordering of boxes.
[ ] Allow embedding of one page inside another.
